The International Health Collective (IHC) strives to alleviate disparities in the San Diegoâ€“Tijuana region and abroad using an approach that is culturally sensitive, holistic, and sustainable. Based at UCSD, IHC is a youth-driven, nonprofit organization run entirely by students and recent alumni. This structure gives IHC the unique ability to constantly innovate and improve its approach in an effort to create lasting change. In addition, IHC also promotes education and research both within the organization and in the communities it serves. IHC works closely with its communities and continually evaluates its efficacy in addressing their needs. IHC's mission is to improve the health, and by extension the lives, of both those we serve and those who provide service.

## Executive Summary

IHC EMR is a mobile application intended for the offline management of IHC patient check-ups. The application aims to digitize the administrative processes of the clinic. This means that IHC volunteers, physicians, and lab technicians can asynchronously share and manage information with one another. The project is primarily concerned with streamlining patient check-ins, triages, lab testing, and pharmacy management.
