The International Health Collective (IHC) strives to alleviate disparities in the San Diegoâ€“Tijuana region and abroad using an approach that is culturally sensitive, holistic, and sustainable. Based at UCSD, IHC is a youth-driven, nonprofit organization run entirely by students and recent alumni. This structure gives IHC the unique ability to constantly innovate and improve its approach in an effort to create lasting change. In addition, IHC also promotes education and research both within the organization and in the communities it serves. IHC works closely with its communities and continually evaluates its efficacy in addressing their needs. IHC's mission is to improve the health, and by extension the lives, of both those we serve and those who provide service.

## Executive Summary

IHC Wellness is a native iOS & Android application that encourages you to perform daily check-ins, log your mood, and record your current activities. By answering a short series of questions daily and doing recommended activities (tailored by the International Health Collective), users earn points that they can spend on purchasing materials to grow a plant. For UCSD students, there is also a calendar of campus wellness events that can be attended for additional points. All of this can be done through the application.
