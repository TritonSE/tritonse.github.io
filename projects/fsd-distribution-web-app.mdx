## Executive Summary

The FSD Distribution Web Application was created with the intention of replacing FSD’s previous data storage system which was based in an Excel file. TSE’s solution tracks information pertaining to food distribution agencies working with FSD. This method greatly simplifies the data management process while also providing a built-in system of organization.
