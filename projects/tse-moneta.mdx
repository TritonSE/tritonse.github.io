## Executive Summary

TSE Moneta was created with the intention of expanding the number of nonprofits TSE could serve at a time. Moneta aims to address the common need of a database/data-management software as reported by many nonprofits. It serves as a unique one-to-many product as opposed to TSEâ€™s typical one-to-one offerings. The website itself is a GUI database that can be thoroughly customized by individual nonprofits. Clients have control over who has access to their database, the number of tables in that database, and the data stored within those tables. This customizability was implemented in order to make the product more broadly applicable to the various needs of different organizations. Data transfer is also simplified through the ability to upload and download CSV data to and from tables.
