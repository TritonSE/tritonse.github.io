## Executive Summary

GreenPoint Rated App is a native iOS & Android application that allows home owners and certified GreenPoint raters (trained by Your Clear Way) to together build health, energy- and resource-efficient homes. The application supports the GreenPoint Rated system which implements and recommends measures and performance benchmarks for home owners to address climate and market conditions. Home owners can upload pictures and manufacture details of their housing facilities, and GreenPoint raters will grant points to the home owners if these facilities fulfill GreenPoint requirements. Everything related to GreenPoint Rated Certification can be completed in this application.
