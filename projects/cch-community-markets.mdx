## Executive Summary

The Center for Community Health is an organization working to improve access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food through their Live Well Community Market Program. The team built an online market assessment tool that removed the tedium and inaccuracy of their previous, paper-based process. TSEâ€™s solution provided users with immediate access to the level of the market. Users were also able to visualize data of markets that have already been assessed with graphs and pie charts. This helped CCH better analyze what areas of San Diego have healthier markets, so that they can easily see what areas need more development when working on improving access to healthy and affordable food.
