## Executive Summary

Summary: The housing portal helps USHS workers actively search for potential housing options and work to pair individuals and their families with the right housing choice that perfectly matches specific needs for a seamless transition. It has 2 key components

1. A protected landlord and unit data entry form that enables expedited, bulk collection of housing (and landlord) data.
2. An internal portal that centralizes housing data management and renter referrals, and enables tracking of the renter candidate process. This will feature a referral process in which staff either enter a candidateâ€™s information or choose from a database of saved candidates.
