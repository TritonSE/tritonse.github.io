## Executive Summary

The Laktaa Bhutan Transport Application is an Android application that connects agricultural collectives and farmers to truckers to facilitate the transportation and distribution of goods. Farmers can post detailed transport jobs that truckers can sign up to fulfill. During the execution of the task, farmers can track the progress and general location of the shipment. Once the job is completed, farmers can rate their experience with the truckers; information that other farmers also have access to later. Laktaa Bhutan staff also have access to an administration tool to suspend accounts that are violating their terms of service.
