## Executive Summary

TSE Oktavian serves as a one-stop-shop for all internal TSE administration. Every user is able to view the TSE roster and each member’s public profile. Oktavian utilizes the same role names that are currently being used within TSE (Executive Board position names, Designers, Developers, Alumni), which are all given different permissions. This streamlines the permission-handling process and alleviates extra bloat introduced by Google Drive. Members can quickly access their own projects’ information and browse other ongoing and completed TSE projects. For more information on the technical aspects of the project, please visit https://github.com/TritonSE/TSE-Oktavian.
