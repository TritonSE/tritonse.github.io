## About the Client

<Gallery layout={[{ width: 70 }, { imageKey: "clients/the_animal_pad", width: 25 }]}>

The Animal Pad is a non-profit, all breed dog rescue that focuses on saving dogs from high kill shelters and the streets of Mexico. TAP gives them vet care, places them in foster homes and then finds them loving forever families. A few years ago, TAP turned their attention to the street dogs of Mexico as there is very little help for them. Since then, TAP has developed a large rescue network in Baja California and TAP has a sister shelter in Ensenada that they focus on taking dogs from whenever funds allow.

## Executive Summary

The Animal Pad Foster Dog Matching Tool is a website that simplifies the process of matching dogs to foster families. Foster families can apply to foster dogs virtually and create a profile to track their application progress. They have access to dog profiles that present all necessary information so the best possible match can be found. On the other side, TAP employees no longer need to go through the arduous task of updating cluttered spreadsheets. Instead, they use the website to quickly and easily change the status of foster applications. Additionally, they will be able to view and manage applicant profiles through the matching process and also create dog profiles. TAP can easily search through profiles based on filters and also save them for future matches.
