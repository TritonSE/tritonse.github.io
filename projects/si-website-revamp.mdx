## Executive Summary

The SI Website Revamp is a complete rebuild of Sakyadhita’s previous website. The goal of the project is to overhaul the site’s design as well as to provide a GUI to edit site content in the form of an admin tool. This admin tool provides complete customization of the user-facing site’s content with a low barrier of entry. All of Sakyadhita’s publications and general organization information is provided to users through the main site. For more information on the technical aspects of the project, please visit https://github.com/TritonSE/SI-Website-Revamp.
