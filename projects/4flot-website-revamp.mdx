## Executive Summary

The revamped website reorganizes 4FLOTâ€™s old website to have the standard pages of an organization's informational website (i.e. Home Page, About Us, Contact Us) with the additions of a Donations page, Testimonials page, Upcoming Events page, and Newsletter page to highlight the impact of 4FLOT in the community and ways for people to help support 4FLOT in its efforts. There is also a form where people can sign up to volunteer, and an admin dashboard for administrators to update photos, create new testimonials, and manage newsletters and event cards.

The site is live at [https://4-flot-website-revamp.vercel.app](https://4-flot-website-revamp.vercel.app)!
