Key Conservation is helping global conservation organizations receive critical funding and support through a platform that provides real-time updates on critical, short-term, and long-term campaigns. Every individual has the ability to make a difference in the world and the Key Conservation platform provides the tools to empower it. Designed by wildlife biologists, the Key platform is a place where conservationists can come to find real-time global support from individuals when all other traditional means fall short. Key is unique in that it provides transparent and real-time interactions between conservation organizations and supporters. This insight provides the supporter with a more comprehensive look at what day-to-day conservation efforts and struggles truly look like and showcases how even small actions from one individual can lead to tremendous impact.
