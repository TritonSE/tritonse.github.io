YStem and Chessâ€™s mission is to empower underserved and at-risk communities with an opportunity to pursue STEM careers and change their life trajectories. We are teaching underserved children and adults chess, math, computer science, and cybersecurity to empower them to pursue STEM majors/professions with the support of professionals.

## Executive Summary

The YStem and Chess Mobile Application serves as a learning and teaching hub for students and mentors to explore chess together. Students are able to create accounts, train puzzles, and practice against other students, mentors, and the computer. Students are incentivized to continue using the application as they will unlock more features as they do so. Mentors can provide guidance through lesson plans and connect with students for individualized training sessions. The application uses the Lichess API which allows for real time gameplay without needing students and mentors to be using the same device.
