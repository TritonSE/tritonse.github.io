## About the Client

<Gallery layout={[{ width: 70 }, { imageKey: "clients/words_alive", width: 25 }]}>

Words Alive was established in 1999 by Leslye Lyons, a social worker and voracious reader. The organization was founded on the belief that if you value reading and understand its fundamental connection to all aspects of your life, then you will be better equipped to thrive as a lifelong learner and productive member of your community.

## Executive Summary

The Words Alive Family Literacy project requires two separate applications, mobile and web, because it is targeting two separate users: the families and Words Alive volunteers. The mobile application is a hub where families are able to conveniently view resources from the Words Alive website in addition to being able to chat with volunteers and receive notifications on upcoming books, events, etc. Additionally, the mobile application also helps users who do not have constant access to an internet connection since the majority of the resources will be included within the initial download. The web application provides the volunteers and staff at Words Alive with a better overview on how well their program is doing through the analytics, live chat, and notifications feature. Similar to the mobile app, the web app is a central hub for Words Alive where they are to conveniently access everything.
