FixNation is a non profit organization in Los Angeles whose mission is to reduce the population of homeless cats by sterilizing as many as possible while demonstrating the effectiveness of Trap-Neuter-Return and colony management for the humane care of homeless cats. FixNation strives to build a better world for cats and envisions a day when all tame cats have a home, and community cats are spayed/neutered and cared for in their outdoor homes.
