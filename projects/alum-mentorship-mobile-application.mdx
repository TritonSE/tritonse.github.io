## Executive Summary

ALUM Mentorship serves as a one-stop-shop for all things related to ALUM and allows students to sign up for 1-on-1 mentoring sessions on their phones. When each mentee signs up for a session, they will fill out a pre-session form with a few short essay questions about their goals and what they aim to achieve through this program. When they complete their session, they will fill out a post-session reflection form. The mentees will be able to refer to these forms in perpetuity from the “Past Sessions” tab. These forms will also be ALUM’s means of holding them accountable with more ease rather than having to manually check attendance, leading to less administrative work.
