The Office of Innovation and Commercialization (OIC) at UCSD “aligns resources to encourage and support an innovative community comprised of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community advocates.” Their mission is to “accelerate the commercialization of UC San Diego innovations and contribute to a sustainable society.” TSE specifically worked with Paul Roben, the Vice Chancellor, and the direct point of contact was Shane Moise who works as a Program Manager at the office.

## Executive Summary

The Innovation Portal was inspired by the portal found on the MIT innovation website and was designed for OIC. The portal is a user centered web page where users can identify themselves as one of the three available personas (students, faculty, or alumni), consequently they can select the categories they are interested in. As a result, the portal will display a list of tiles representing the resources that matched the user’s query. The portal was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a WordPress environment and uses the WP posts as the database storing the resources.
