## Executive Summary

This web application helps Patriots and Paws manage their requests for furnishings and has two components:

1. A Staff/Admin Portal that helps PAP staff aggregate, manage, and search through Veteran Service Requests, facilitating efficient tracking, analysis, and responsiveness to the needs of veterans.
2. A Veteran Portal / Digital Veteran Service Request Form (VSR) Form that enables veterans to submit requests digitally. This minimizes the need for printing and scanning a physical form, shifting the entire process to an online format.

The site is live at [https://vsr.patriotsandpaws.org/vsr](https://vsr.patriotsandpaws.org/vsr)!
