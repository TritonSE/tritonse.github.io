## About the Client

<Gallery layout={[{ width: 70 }, { imageKey: "clients/make_a_wish", width: 25 }]}>

Make-A-Wish is an organization built upon granting wishes for children with critical illnesses. Wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than gifts, or singular events in time. Wishes impact everyone involved—wish kids, volunteers, donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. For wish kids, just the act of making their wish come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical treatments. Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.

## Executive Summary

The Make-A-Wish Volunteer Hub was made with the intention of providing a centralized location for volunteer resources. Previously, there was no easily-accessible, official consolidation of resources for volunteers to refer to. Along with organizing volunteer information, the MAW Volunteer Hub strives to create a customized, comprehensible, and user-friendly UI. Volunteers can create their own accounts; search for, create, edit, and delete documents; add events; and view/organize information on their calendars. All of these features make the process of volunteering for Make–A-Wish much more intuitive. By reducing the barrier of entry, TSE’s product hopes to draw more volunteers to Make-A-Wish.
