## Executive Summary

The Data Visualization website incorporates interactive data visualization tools from Tableau that allow users to easily view and understand valuable statistical information about the specific business region. There will be different use cases depending on the tier of membership. The free tier allows users to interact with simple databases regarding tax data or graphs and view PDFs or other data. The paid tier allows users to interact with higher quality detailed databases, graphs, charts, analytics, and PDFs. Paid users can also manipulate, replace, test different factors of tax data and view outputted graphs and data displays.
