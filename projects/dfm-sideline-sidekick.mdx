## Executive Summary

Sideline Sidekick is a mobile application that allows users to browse treatements by categories or search up keywords and have the treatment associated with the keyword pop up. For example, looking up shoulder injury will display the procedure for how to deal with it. There is also an admin portal where admins can add and edit pages and sections.
