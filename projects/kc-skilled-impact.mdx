<Gallery layout={[{ width: 70 }, { imageKey: "clients/key_conservation", width: 25 }]}>

Key Conservation is helping global conservation organizations receive critical funding and support through a platform that provides real-time updates on critical, short-term, and long-term campaigns. Every individual has the ability to make a difference in the world and the Key Conservation platform provides the tools to empower it. Designed by wildlife biologists, the Key platform is a place where conservationists can come to find real-time global support from individuals when all other traditional means fall short. Key is unique in that it provides transparent and real-time interactions between conservation organizations and supporters. This insight provides the supporter with a more comprehensive look at what day-to-day conservation efforts and struggles truly look like and showcases how even small actions from one individual can lead to tremendous impact.

## Executive Summary

A collaboration between Key Conservation and Lambda School Labs to help build a social network for volunteers and philanthropists. This was an expansion of the Key Conservation app to allow supporters to build a resum√© of their skills and past volunteer experience, and to allow conservationist organizations to find skilled help for their campaigns. From their Android or iOS devices, supporters can follow campaigns they're interested in, advertise their skills, and apply to organizations looking for skilled help. From the same app, conservationist organizations can share their progress, post applications, and review candidates.
