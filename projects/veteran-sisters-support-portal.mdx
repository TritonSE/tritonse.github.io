## Executive Summary

We are building a role-based, secure portal and management system for female veterans, MST survivors, volunteers, staff, and donors. Veterans and MST survivors can be paired with Battle Buddies and counselors, who can support them and help them manage their documents.

The project is currently under development and scheduled to finish around June!
