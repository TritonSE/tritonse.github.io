## Onboarding

We start by getting to know your organization, your mission, and your vision. Only then do we begin the ideation process, where we'll brainstorm a variety of ideas for what TSE can build for you. Our outreach team will draft a project proposal that details exactly what a partnership with TSE looks like.

Once this proposal is complete, we move on to the design stage.
