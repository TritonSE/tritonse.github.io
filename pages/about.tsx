          When not heads-down designing and developing, we set time aside to create opportunities to
          bond through games and mentorship. We care about celebrate each otherâ€™s successes as well!
          As a student member at TSE, you gain valuable skills and a network of talented peers who
          share a drive to do good for the community.
