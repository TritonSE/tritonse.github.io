            In Spring of 2017, a group of passionate students saw a huge problem: many nonprofits
            had little to no resources to procure professional web and technical development
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response, they banded together to create Triton Software Engineering. By providing a
            venue for both UCSD students and nonprofits to connect, they hoped to foster growth in
            both social good and technical expertise.

        <h2>More than a team.</h2>
        <p>
          When not heads-down designing and developing, we set time aside to create opportunities to
          bond through games and mentorship. We care about celebrate each other’s successes as well!
          As a student member at TSE, you gain valuable skills and a network of talented peers who
          share a drive to do good for the community.
