## FAQs

### How are TSE projects structured?

TSEâ€™s structure consists of our board and 6 project-based teams. Each project team is made up of an engineering manager, a product manager, 6 developers, and 2-3 designers. Teams work independently of one another to create software for the nonprofit organization that they have been assigned to.

### What resources does TSE have to ensure success?

Our organization recruits some of the most hard-working, passionate, and brightest students at UC San Diego. Through effective leadership, frequent check-ins, and organized project timelines set with our clients and board, we ensure that our combination of talent, dedication, and care will result in projects that benefit the nonprofits we work with.

### How is TSE operating during the ongoing pandemic?

We are working in a hybrid model with most project teams primarily meeting in person. All TSE meetings with nonprofit clients will continue to be remote.
